Reproducible Science @ TACC
===========================

**Why Reproducible Science?**

Fundamentally, it is about using best practices to maximize the impact and value of your effort.
It is both leveraging the prior work of others, while ensuring that your own work is a trustworthy foundation that may be built upon by yourself and others in the future.
Our instruction team includes TACC staff from both Life Sciences Computing and Cloud & Interactive Computing.
We have selected a set of topics that we think are most important to using High Performance Computing (HPC) in a manner that promotes Reproducible Science.
